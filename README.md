## Progressive rock rankings web scraping

In this code, we perform web scraping of a website. Web scraping is the activity of extracting information 
from one or more websites in an automated way. We usually do this when we want data that is not available 
through APIs.

The target site is [Prog Archives](http://www.progarchives.com/). It is a progressive rock website with an 
active community that indexes various genres, bands and albums, with ratings and comments. This website is 
the most complete and powerful progressive rock resource. Prog Archives has a very robust search engine that 
allows us to search the albums of each year, by genre and country.
